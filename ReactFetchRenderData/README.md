![Landing page](./fetchAndRender_ui_ss.png "alternate landing page")


Fetch and Render service is one of vital coding exercise in my MERN training module. This UI, which is created using React components, fetches data from backend and render it to users in formatted and beautified manner. It fetches stories from various new anchors/feeders and render it to users on a paginated page. It is near to real world solution which could be easily adopted by business for internal use with their customers and employees. At this stage, this application is not completed or ready for use. I'm working on it to make it work as expected. I have added screenshot of issue i was facing when implementing the same code that works in training environment but not in my local setup. I’m working to resolve this issue.
